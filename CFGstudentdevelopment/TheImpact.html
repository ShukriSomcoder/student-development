    <p align="left"> My research is about an aspect of the human condition, namely growth, and how this is experienced by undergraduates in the context of coaching. I argue that growth can be intentionally stimulated through coaching. I also explore what growth actually is for these students and how they experience it. This may help other students and professionals to recognise and encourage growth in the highly contextualised arena of university. I also offer recommendations for how you can help foster your own growth. </p>
    <p align="left">Here are some quotations from the students who took part in the study</p>

        <p class="chat-message">Coaching has helped me quite a lot.  If I didn’t do the coaching I’d not be doing as well as I am now.  Especially with certain areas like procrastination.  I’d be a wreck actually.</p>

        <p class="chat-message">I don’t think I will freak out because like the stuff I will carry with me for like the rest of my life, like these little tips.  It’s like.</p>

    <div class="chat other" align="left">
      <div class="user-photo"></div>
      <p class="chat-message">I think I would have got there eventually but coaching has speeded up my realising things like a catalyst.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="chat other" align="right">
      <div class="user-photo"></div>
      <p class="chat-message">I now have better life plans, like a clearer direction of where I'm heading, I'm more motivated to apply for things, to get involved in things, to work hard at university, to study hard, and to basically achieve these plans that I've got, and these plans that I value.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="chat self" align="right">
      <div class="user-photo"></div>
      <p class="chat-message">Mostly you just go through life doing what you are doing and you don’t really think about it.  So that’s quite nice to turn round and actually consider it.</p>

    <div class="chat other" align="left">
      <div class="user-photo"></div>
      <p class="chat-message">It is quite challenging to really think about like what you do and how you feel about yourself and things.</p>

      <div class="user-photo"></div>
      <p class="chat-message">I think there is an element of personal growth anyway at university but I feel like it’s being kind of accelerated with coaching.</p>

      <p class="chat-message">I would have felt a lot more on my own if I hadn’t had coaching</p>

    <div class="chat self" align="right">
      <div class="user-photo"></div>
      <p class="chat-message">I honestly think coaching would be so helpful to everyone. There are so many of my friends who are so stressed out and I’m kind of a little bit more sorted.</p>

    <div class="chat other" align="left">
      <div class="user-photo"></div>
      <p class="chat-message">Coaching has enabled me to deal with problems as looking for a solution and like a forward journey as opposed to it just being like something completely out of reach that stresses me out.</p>
